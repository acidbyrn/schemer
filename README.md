Terminal Colorscheme Generator
==============================

# Please note:

If you have no strong reason to use this version specifically, please instead use [schemer2](https://github.com/thefryscorer/schemer2). It has many more features, and a smarter interface. Any new features added will be added to schemer2.

The reason schemer2 is a separate project is to support the AUR package (Now removed), and not break the existing workflow of anybody who has incorporated schemer into scripts or other programs. Additionally, schemer2 does not feature the SDL rendered preview.

## Installation 

### Short version

> go get github.com/thefryscorer/schemer

### Long Version

#### Installing and configuring Go
To build this program, you will need to have Go installed and properly configured. After installing the Go package, you will need to configure a GOPATH. This is a directory in which Go will keep its programs and source files. I recommend making the GOPATH directory in your home folder. If your GOPATH is in your root directory a kitten will die. 

> mkdir ~/Go

You will also need to set the GOPATH variable so that Go knows where to put things. You can do this by running:

> export GOPATH=$HOME/Go

NOTE: You don't need to (and shouldn't) set the $GOROOT variable. This is handled for you and you shouldn't mess with it.

#### Installing SDL1.2
This program also makes use of SDL1.2 for the color preview window (which you can use by adding the "-d" flag in schemer). As such, SDL1.2 will need to be installed on your system for you to build and run schemer.

**To install SDL1.2 in ArchLinux:**

> sudo pacman -S sdl sdl_image sdl_ttf sdl_mixer

**To install SDL1.2 in Mac OS:**

> brew install sdl sdl_image sdl_ttf sdl_mixer

If you haven't installed HomeBrew, you can find it at http://brew.sh 


**To install SDL1.2 on another system:**

Learn how to use Google and your package manager. Both are very useful. 

#### Installing schemer
You should now be able to install schemer using the command:

> go get github.com/thefryscorer/schemer

And it will be built in your GOPATH directory, in a subdirectory named 'bin'. To run it, you can either add $HOME/Go/bin to your system path and run it as you would any other command. Or cd into the bin directory and run it with:

> ./schemer
